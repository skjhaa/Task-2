    <h2 align= left>History of Darbhanga</h2>
    
    <p>Darbhanga is made up of two words Dar and Banga which means to Gateway of Bengal. Darbhanga Raj, also known as Raj Darbhanga and the Khandwala dynasty, was a Maithil Brahmin dynasty and the rulers of territories, not all contiguous, that were part of the Mithila region, now divided between India and Nepal.  

    The Khandaval dynasty was one of many Brahmin dynasties to rule in India, doing so in the Mithila/Tirhut region from the time of the Mughal emperor Akbar until the 1960s. They became known as the Raj Darbhanga. The extent of their lands, which were not contiguous, varied over time, and their area of ownership was smaller than the area that they were granted under sanad arrangements. A particularly significant reduction occurred when the influence of the British Raj caused them to lose control of the territories that were in Nepal but, nonetheless, their holdings were considerable. One estimate suggests that when their rule came to an end, the territories comprised around 6,200 square kilometres (2,400 sq mi), with around 4500 villages

    Under the British Rule, Darbhanga was a part of Sarkar Tirhut up to 1875, when it was constituted into a separate district. The subdivisions had been created earlier – Darbhanga Sadar in 1845, Madhubani in 1866 and Samastipur (then known as Tajpur) in 1867. It was the part of Patna division till 1908, when the Tirhut division was created with its headquarters at Muzaffarpur. As a result of reorganization of districts in the State which took effect in the year 1972, Madhubani and Samastipur subdivision were upgraded as independent districts and then the trimmed Darbhanga district has two subdivisions, viz, Darbhanga Sadar and Benipur consisting of 12 Development Blocks in all. Biraul Subdivision was created in 1992 and six more Development Blocks were created namely Hanuman Nagar, Tardih, Gaura Bauram, Kiratpur, Kusheshwar Asthan East and Alinagar in later stage.
The district is bounded on the north by Madhubani district, on the south by the district of Samastipur, on the east by Saharsa district and on the west by the district of Muzaffarpur and Sitamarhi.

        <h2 align= left>Agriculture</h2> 
            <p>
                KrishiVigyan Kendra, Jaale, Darbhanga was established by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research in June, 2004 under the administrative control of Rajendra Agricultural University, Pusa, Samastipur; Bihar observing the possibilities and potentialities of growing cereals, pulses, fruits and vegetables as well as medicinal and aromatic plants in the alluvial fertile tracts of Darbhanga district. Since then, it has proved to be one of the leading centers for front line extension education in the district mandated to organize vocational trainings in agriculture and allied vocations with emerging advances in agriculture research on regular basis. The Centre is also dedicated to organize and conduct front line demonstrations in consultation with subject matter specialist for testing, refining and documenting region specific and sustainable land use system. The Centre has conducted more than 48 OnFarm Trials since its inception for technology assessment, refinement and validation and documented a number of technologies for the microclimatic situation of Darbhanga district of Bihar. The recommendations based on the On Farm Trials are well adopted by the farmers and a number of Front Line Demonstrations have also been conducted for broad basing of the technology.

There was an overall increase of 30-60% in yield over Farmers” Practice apart from saving in cost of cultivation and conservation of natural resources. The short and long duration training programmes, both on campus and off campus, was very much effective in employment generation and all round development of the farmers as well as of rural youths. Cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants, vermicomposting, tie and dye, organic farming, resource conservation technology along with Integrated Farming System and fruit and vegetable preservation were the prime concern during the year that attracted the young generation and a number of rural youths could get their agri-enterprises established through self-employment. Since the district is facing severe drought situation receiving nearly half of the normal rainfall during last fifteen years, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, then a number of technologies have been devised to fight the challenges of climatic vagaries and the farmers are now able to take satisfactory yield levels even during drought and flood situations. Efforts on natural resource management, introduction of drought and flood tolerant varieties, conservation tillage, staggered rice nurseries and innovative approaches of establishing Custom Hiring Center for assured and timely sowing of crops have tremendous effects on increasing and sustaining crop production. The prevailing Rice-Wheat cropping system are being diversified and intensified to suit the demand of the farmers as well as to the micro-climatic condition and efforts are being made to have food security, nutritional security and above all the economic security of the farming community. This is just a matter of time that we could prove our worth in terms of overall economic growth of the farmers of Saran district and of the country as a whole. Search for : SEARCH
